Thank you for this take home opportunity!

I had seen this problem before but never completed it myself.
After researching the background of Conway's Game of Life I developed a
good understanding of the problem and expected solution.

As the algorithm implementation was new to me, I began with a brute force version.
There are many ways I would make my code more efficient, the most blaring one being
to reduce duplication in the checking and counting of neighbors.

In testing my work towards the end of the allocated time, I noticed an error in the
calculation of the first line, realizing I need to only check for neighbors above and
below if they actually exist.

With more time I would also be sure to display the values better,
split in array lengths of 10 to display the grid properly.

I'm sure there are many more improvements that could be made,
and I appreciate the challenge for my own learning.

Thank you!
